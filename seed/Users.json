        "ingredients": "Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.
        · Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.
        · Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.
        · Butter: A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.
        · Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.
        · Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.
        · Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.",
